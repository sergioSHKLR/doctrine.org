# 🏠 Home

Inspired in other initiatives of digital education and communication, we created this alternative which combines dispersed sources and tools providing the user with a first-of-its-kind integrated study platform.

Our interface is composed of three columns which are selectively displayed according to the width of the device it is being used. This way you'll see three columns in large screens, two in medium screens, and only one on small screens.

Read the <kbd>📋 Info</kbd> page to get to know the standards utilized in our project.

In case of any doubts, please contact us via the chat button (lower right corner) <img src="./framework/crisp-logo.svg" width="30" height="30" alt="botão do crisp chat" style="all: unset; height: 30px; vertical-align: text-bottom;">

We'd thankful for your feedback!

🙏🏼 So be it!
